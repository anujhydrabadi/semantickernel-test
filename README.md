## Description

This project demonstrates how to integrate the Semantic Kernel with OpenAI in a Spring Boot application. The Semantic Kernel is a powerful library for natural language processing, and OpenAI provides state-of-the-art AI models.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/semantic-kernel-openai-springboot.git
    cd semantic-kernel-openai-springboot
    ```

2. **Build the project:**

    Ensure you have Maven installed. Then, run:

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

3. **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can test the Semantic Kernel with OpenAI by making requests to the endpoints exposed by your Spring Boot application. 

For example, you might use a tool like Postman or `curl` to make HTTP requests to your application.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/your-endpoint -d '{"your": "data"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
